When your dev env is broken, spend that time building useful things outside of it. I present [tstatus.lol](http://www.tstatus.lol), a simple tool I built to check if an internal dev environment was working. It's really just a counter that increments when you hit it - no actual connection to any status API. But building it taught me how to work with AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway, which was worth the time investment.
