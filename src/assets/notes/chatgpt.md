I've been writing code professionally for five years. When I began my career transition away from music in the summer of 2020, the path seemed clear: learn CS fundamentals, master a language and a framework or two, climb the ladder. Technical knowledge == golden ticket.

In April 2020 I was offered my first tech gig, an internship on a mid-sized bank's credit card servicing web team. I was fortunate to be immediately surrounded by smart, kind, gracious, and generous engineers who took me in and showed me the ropes, often by throwing me in the deep end and letting me figure things out. I'd spend a whole sprint writing unit tests, figuring out flexbox, or learning how to write a new endpoint. I spent my days trying and failing, reading docs, trying again, failing again, asking for help, googling, googling some more. I learned more in 8 months on the job than in the 2 years I spent in CS classes. Then, in December 2021 I learned that I had achieved the dream – I was offered a full-time role on the bank's mobile banking team. Did I have mobile experience? Nope! Did I know anything about iOS or Android dev? Nope! What kind of phone did I have? An iPhone. iOS team it was. Again, I was thrown in the deep end. Docs. More docs. Tutorials. Trial. Error. Failure. Patience.

That world disappeared the moment ChatGPT arrived.

ChatGPT changed everything overnight. That sprint I spent writing unit tests as an intern? Done in 30 seconds. The hours I spent parsing through Stack Overflow threads from 2014 trying to understand why my SwiftUI view wouldn't render properly? Answered instantly, with example code. The careful mentorship of senior developers explaining architectural patterns? Now available on demand, 24/7, with infinite patience for my stupid questions.

I should feel grateful. And in many ways, I am. The tedium is gone. The friction has been smoothed away. I can ship features faster than I ever thought possible.

So why does it feel like something important has been lost?

## The Deep End

There's a moment I think about often. A few months into my iOS role, I was given my first real feature: a complete rewrite of mobile deposits. Not a small bug fix. Not a minor UI tweak. A full rewrite of one of the app's core features. And of the 3 of us on the iOS team, only one had any real experience.

I had no idea what I was doing.

I spent weeks reading through the existing codebase, trying to understand how camera permissions worked, how image processing happened, how the deposit flow connected to the backend. I drew diagrams. I wrote pseudocode. I bothered my senior colleague with endless questions. I felt completely out of my depth, certain that someone would realize they'd made a terrible mistake giving me this responsibility.

But slowly, painfully, it started to make sense. Not just the mobile deposit feature, but how to approach unfamiliar problems. How to break down something overwhelming into manageable pieces. How to read code as a map of decisions someone else had made. The struggle itself had taught me something that had nothing to do with the specific problem I was solving.

I came from classical percussion. I spent years in practice rooms working through pieces that were just beyond my ability, building technical facility one measure at a time, sitting with complex rhythmic patterns until my hands and brain finally aligned. You can't skip that part. There's no shortcut to developing musical intuition. The struggle *is* the teacher.

What happens when we remove the struggle from learning to code?

## The Question We're Not Asking

Here's what I notice with junior developers who started after ChatGPT: they're fast. Incredibly fast. They can scaffold applications, implement features, and fix bugs at a pace that would have seemed impossible to me as an intern. They're also often... brittle.

When something breaks in an unexpected way, when the AI-generated solution doesn't quite work, when the problem requires understanding rather than implementation - that's where things get shaky. Not always. Not everyone. But enough that I've noticed a pattern.

It's not their fault. They're learning to code in the world that exists, not the one that used to exist. But I wonder if they're learning to code at all, or if they're learning to prompt. And I wonder if that distinction matters.

Maybe it doesn't. Maybe I'm just old, already nostalgic for a world that existed three years ago. Maybe the skills that matter have simply shifted, and what I think of as "real" coding knowledge is just gatekeeping dressed up as pedagogy.

But then I think about what actually makes someone a good engineer, and I'm not sure it's changed as much as we think.

## What Actually Matters

The best engineers I've worked with aren't necessarily the ones who can write the most elegant code or who have memorized the most algorithms. They're the ones who ask good questions. Who can look at a problem and think about second-order effects. Who understand not just how to build something, but whether it should be built, and what the tradeoffs are.

They're the ones who can say "this AI-generated solution will work, but it's going to make the codebase harder to maintain" or "we could ship this feature, but it doesn't actually solve the user's problem." They've developed judgment. Taste. Intuition about what matters.

Can you develop those things without the struggle? I honestly don't know. Maybe. Probably. The human brain is remarkably adaptable, and every generation finds new ways to develop expertise.

But I do know that my own judgment came from making a lot of mistakes. From implementing things the wrong way and living with the consequences. From spending hours debugging only to realize the problem was a single misplaced character. From that specific flavor of frustration that comes from knowing something should work but it doesn't and you can't figure out why.

Those experiences taught me patience. They taught me systematic thinking. They taught me humility. They taught me that coding isn't just about making the computer do what you want - it's about understanding complex systems, managing uncertainty, and being wrong in increasingly sophisticated ways.

## The Mentorship Question

I think a lot about the developers who taught me. The senior engineer who would let me struggle with a problem for an hour before gently pointing me in the right direction. The tech lead who made me explain my reasoning before approving my MRs, even when we both knew his way would be faster.

What does mentorship look like now? When a junior developer can ask ChatGPT instead of asking me, what's my role? Am I still needed?

The optimistic answer is that mentorship becomes more valuable, not less. That junior developers need help with exactly the things AI can't teach: judgment, context, career navigation, learning how to learn. That the relationship shifts from information transfer to something more nuanced.

The pessimistic answer is that we're all just becoming middle managers for AI, and the craft itself is being hollowed out. That we're losing the generational transfer of tacit knowledge that happens when an experienced developer sits with a struggling junior and works through a problem together.

I don't know which answer is right. Probably both contain some truth.

## What I Tell Myself

I use AI tools constantly. I'd be lying if I said otherwise. They're incredible. But I've noticed that I use them differently than developers who started with them.

I use them to speed up things I already know how to do. To generate boilerplate. To remember syntax I've forgotten. To explore APIs I'm unfamiliar with. To give me starting points to troubleshoot bugs.But I don't use it to think for me. When I'm stuck on a hard problem, I still open miro or grab paper and start drawing diagrams. I still explain the problem out loud to my rubber duck or whoever happens to be close by. I still try things, fail, and try again.

Maybe that's just habit. Maybe it's inefficient. Maybe in five more years I'll look back and laugh at how precious I was being about "really understanding" things.

But for now, I'm holding onto something. The belief that there's value in the struggle itself. That the friction isn't just an obstacle to be removed, but part of the process of becoming someone who can build things that matter.

I don't know if junior developers today are missing something essential by not spending sprints writing unit tests by hand. Maybe they're learning different skills that are just as valuable. Maybe they're learning to orchestrate AI tools in ways that will seem as fundamental to them as reading documentation seems to me.

But I do know this: the problems worth solving aren't going to get easier. The complexity isn't going away. And at some point, when you're deep in a gnarly bug at 2am and Stack Overflow has nothing and ChatGPT is hallucinating solutions, you're going to need something more than the ability to prompt.

You're going to need the kind of understanding that only comes from sitting with the discomfort. From trying and failing. From the slow, patient work of actually learning to code.

At least, that's what I tell myself.

Maybe I'm wrong. That would be very on-brand for me.

But I learned that from classical percussion too: fail, trying again, fail again, and eventually - if you're patient and you pay attention - succeed. We used to call it woodshedding. Hours alone in the practice room, working through a passage until your hands understood it without your brain needing to think. There was no shortcut. There still isn't.

Maybe there shouldn't be one for code either.
