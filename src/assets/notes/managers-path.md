I started an MBA last year and had to write my first book report in a long time. I read "The Manager's Path" by Camille Fournier. It's a guide for tech leads, senior engineers, and managers, but would be valuable for any stage of a career. It covers the different stages of a tech career and the skills needed to succeed at each stage. The book is full of practical advice and real-world examples. It covers topics like mentoring, managing teams, and dealing with difficult people. It refreshingly gives ample time to the importance of communication, empathy, and self-awareness.
