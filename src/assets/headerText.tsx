        <p>👋 Hi, I'm Spencer. I like being creative and making things and experiences that people enjoy. This is a place for me to share what I find interesting and explore my love of writing.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
         For over 10 years I was a full-time orchestra musician and music teacher. I took over 40 professional auditions, which somehow makes me both an expert and a failure.  
        During the pandemic, as a respite from the loss of work, I rediscovered my high-school-era enthusaism for coding, watched too much Silicon Valley, and went back to school. Fast forward five whirlwind years and I'm a "senior" software engineer who still sometimes gets paid to play drums.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p> PS, If you feel stuck in the orchesta world and want a change, reach out. There are many of us, and we can help.
